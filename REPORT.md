# Online Store Usability Test

## First Round of Testing

**First Test:**
- User notes that the check mark on the store front page is too big
- User is confused as to why they can't insert more than one of each item in the cart from the store front page
- User assumes the page title is clickable and it points to store front page, regardless of where they are in the checkout process
- When user inputs something but the button to proceed doesnâ€™t activate, they are confused and would like to know which field needs attention.
- The user notes that the confirmation page layout is slightly confusing

**Second Test:**
- User notes the blue continue button is placed awkwardly on shipping and billing page
- User notes the blue checkmark when adding to cart is too big
- User got confused when going to the billing page because it looks very similar to the shipping page and thought they did something wrong
- Information from shipping did not carry over properly to billing and had trouble finding the problem
- User notes that the checks to make sure information is correct were very good

**Third Test:**
- User notes the blue continue button is placed awkwardly on shipping and billing page
- User notes the blue checkmark when adding to cart is too big
- User notes items in pre-checkout might look better with more space between them
- User would have liked a confirmation number sent to their email after done shopping

## Second Round of Testing

**First Test:**

**Second Test:**
- User notes that on mobile the navigaion bar should be centered and a tad smaller
- User was conflicted about being able to remove from cart in shopping page. Feature was new to user and wasn't a fan but could see the benefit
- User wanted to see the amount of items in the cart from the store page
- User was confused by country code, can enter example like "+1" similar to how name has "John Doe". Could also benefit from having an indicator for the country attached such as a flag
- User clicked on billing button in naviagion when in shipping page which led to a 404 error
- User would have liked a confirmation number to be sent to their email on the thank you page
- User noted that there was no obvious way to get back to store and there should be an express button to take the user back
- User notes that the site flows nicely and looks nice and concise


**Third Test:**
- User experienced a bug on store/home page where clicking the add to cart button for the first time brought them immediately to the shipping page. This did not occur again after going back and continuing.
- User notes it may be beneficial to have the items in alphabetical order in the future if more items are added.
- User notes all pages flow very nicely and was easy to use!
