# Online Store Usability Test

## First Round of Testing

**First Test:**
- User notes that the check mark on the store front page is too big
- User is confused as to why they can't insert more than one of each item in the cart from the store front page
- User assumes the page title is clickable and it points to store front page, regardless of where they are in the checkout process
- When user inputs something but the button to proceed doesnâ€™t activate, they are confused and would like to know which field needs attention.
- The user notes that the confirmation page layout is slightly confusing
